NTP - The Network Time Protocol

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize a
computer to Internet time servers or other sources, such as a radio or
satellite receiver or telephone modem service. It can also be used as
a server for dependent clients. It provides accuracies typically less
than a millisecond on LANs and up to a few milliseconds on WANs.

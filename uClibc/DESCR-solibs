uClibc - A C library for embedded Linux

uClibc (pronounced yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded
Linux systems. It is much smaller than the GNU C Library, but nearly all
applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc.

This package contains the shared libraries libc, etc.

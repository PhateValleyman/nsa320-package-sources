tcp_wrappers - Wietse Venema's network logger

These programs log the client host name of incoming telnet, ftp, rsh,
rlogin, finger etc. requests. Security options are: access control per
host, domain and/or service; detection of host name spoofing or host
address spoofing; booby traps to implement an early-warning system.
